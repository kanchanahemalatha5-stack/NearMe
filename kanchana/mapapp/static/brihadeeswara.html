        The Brihadeeshwara Temple's specialties include its massive, single-piece granite construction, its unique Dravidian architectural style, and its status as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Other notable features are its towering vimana (temple tower), which is the tallest of its kind, the enormous monolithic Nandi statue, and one of the largest Shiva Lingams in the country.
